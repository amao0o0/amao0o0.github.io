I am currently an AI scientist at the [Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R), A*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r/), where I work within the Aural & Language Intelligence Team. My focus is on Large Language Models, Multi-modal Models and AI for Education.

Before joining A*STAR, I earned my Ph.D. at the University of Southern California [USC](https://www.usc.edu/) under the supervision of Prof. [C.-C. Jay Kuo](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Kuo/Chung-Chieh). During my Ph.D., I conducted research in Natural Language Processing, and Image and Signal Processing. Additionally, I completed a rewarding internship at Amazon, where I had the opportunity to work with [Karim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karim-bouyarmane/) and many other talented scientists. During this time, I gained valuable experience in applying Large Language Models to E-commerce.
